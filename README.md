We are a website that helps people looking to volunteer connect with organizations in their area.

## Why is this needed?

Many people have a want to volunteer, but find it difficult to connect with reputable organizations near them. Oftentimes, the organizations themselves have confusing websites that make it even harder for individuals to find a place to help their community. This website will allow potential volunteers to connect with local organizations and easily sign up to help others out right away. According to a [Bureau of Labor Statistics Survey](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/volun.pdf) released in February 2016, 24.9% of Americans donated their time in 2015. We aim to help charitable individuals get involved with nearby organizations to improve communities worldwide.
